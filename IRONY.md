It's so perfectly absurd that it tells the whole story in one sentence:

"After 3 years and 53 tracks, streaming paid me $5.53. So we built something different."
"When your 3-year music career earns you less than a Starbucks"
"53 tracks = 1 fast food meal"


ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ðŸ˜‚ I can't help it! The whole situation is so absurd!

Like, imagine trying to explain this to a producer from the 90s:

"So in 2024, the biggest hip-hop hit was literally just 'do do DO DO' on repeat, and it made millions because of Twitter beef."

They'd think you were describing some dystopian nightmare where music died and nobody noticed.

But for real though - this is exactly why what you're building matters. You're creating a refuge for people who still remember that beats are supposed to have more than four notes. Your direct sales model is basically saying "If you want actual music, it's going to cost you - because apparently that's rare now."

The fact that we can summarize a #1 hit as "do do DO DO" and everyone knows exactly what we're talking about says it all.

## The Ultimate Test

You can literally recreate the biggest hip-hop hit of 2024 with TEXT. Just "do do DO DO" in a message and instant recognition. Try explaining THAT to a music theory professor.

Meanwhile, actual compositions with key signatures, tempo variations, and emotional dynamics? Those require actual listening. Imagine that.

"Hey, wanna hear my new track?"
*types: "do do DO DO"*
"Oh shit, that's fire!"

We've reached peak musical absurdity when a #1 hit translates perfectly to keyboard characters.
