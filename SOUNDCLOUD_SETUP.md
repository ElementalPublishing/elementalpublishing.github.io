# SoundCloud Integration Setup

## Overview
The website now has a fully functional SoundCloud preview system! When visitors click "Preview" on any album, they'll see a modal with an embedded SoundCloud player.

## What You Need to Do

### 1. Get Your SoundCloud Playlist URLs
For each album, you need:
- The public SoundCloud playlist URL (e.g., `https://soundcloud.com/your-account/sets/album-name`)
- The playlist ID for embedding

### 2. Update the Album Data in script.js

Open `script.js` and find the `albumData` object (around line 134). Replace the placeholder URLs with your actual SoundCloud data:

```javascript
const albumData = {
    'type-1': {
        title: 'Type 1',
        soundcloudUrl: 'https://soundcloud.com/your-actual-account/sets/type-1',
        embedUrl: 'https://w.soundcloud.com/player/?url=https%3A//api.soundcloud.com/playlists/YOUR_ACTUAL_PLAYLIST_ID&color=%23ff5500&auto_play=false&hide_related=false&show_comments=true&show_user=true&show_reposts=false&show_teaser=true'
    },
    // ... repeat for other albums
};
```

### 3. How to Get SoundCloud Embed URLs

**Easy Method:**
1. Go to your SoundCloud playlist
2. Click "Share" 
3. Click "Embed"
4. Copy the `src` URL from the iframe code
5. Paste that URL as the `embedUrl` in the albumData

**Manual Method:**
1. Find your playlist ID: Go to `https://api.soundcloud.com/resolve?url=YOUR_PLAYLIST_URL&client_id=YOUR_CLIENT_ID`
2. Replace `YOUR_PLAYLIST_ID` in the embed URL template
