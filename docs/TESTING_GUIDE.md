## PayPal Sandbox Testing (FREE)

### What is PayPal Sandbox?
PayPal Sandbox is a free testing environment that simulates real transactions without any actual money changing hands. Perfect for testing your purchase flow!

### How to Set Up PayPal Sandbox:

1. **Create PayPal Developer Account**
   - Go to https://developer.paypal.com
   - Sign up with your regular PayPal account (or create one)
   - This is completely FREE

2. **Create Sandbox Accounts**
   - In PayPal Developer Dashboard, go to "Sandbox" > "Accounts"
   - Create a "Business" account (this will be your seller account)
   - Create a "Personal" account (this will be your test buyer)
   - Both accounts come with fake money for testing!

3. **Update Your PayPal Buttons**
   - Replace your live PayPal button code with sandbox versions
   - Use sandbox.paypal.com instead of paypal.com
   - Use your sandbox business account email

### Test Flow:
1. Click "Buy Direct - $15" on your website
2. PayPal redirects to SANDBOX PayPal (fake money)
3. Log in with your sandbox personal account
4. Complete fake purchase
5. Get redirected to your download page
6. Test the email delivery system
