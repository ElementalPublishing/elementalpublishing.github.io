How to Give AI-Generated Characters a Place in Your Universe
1. Bot Generation
User generates a new character in Discord (using your AI art bot).
2. Automatic Web Page Creation
The bot collects:
Prompt/description
User’s name or Discord ID
AI-generated image
(Optional) Other lore or attributes filled out by the user
The bot (or a backend script) creates a new HTML page (e.g., /html/ai-00123.html), filling in a template with the character info and image.
The page is automatically linked into the main character index (like spiderfox.html).
3. Optional Database
If you want more flexibility (editing, searching, relationships), store character data in a database (Google Sheets, Notion, SQLite, etc.) and generate HTML from it.
4. Public Display
Visitors can browse new AI-created characters just like your hand-made ones.
Each page could show who created it, when, and how (e.g., “Created by Discord user @username via AI bot”).
Example Workflow
User:
!character cosmic dragon, elementalpublishingstyle, guardian of time and space
Bot:
Generates art and summary.
Automatically creates /html/ai-cosmic-dragon.html with:
AI-generated image
User’s description
Attribution (“Created by @User”)
Updates index page (e.g., spiderfox.html) to add a link.
Replies in Discord: “Your character now lives in the Elemental Publishing Universe! View their page”
How to Automate This
Backend script (Python, Node.js) listens for new AI creations.
When a new character is created:
Fills out a pre-defined HTML template with relevant info.
Saves the new page to your server (via FTP, SFTP, or GitHub Pages PRs).
Updates the main index page.
You can review or moderate new entries if you want.
