# Testing Your PayPal Integration

## Current Issue with PayPal.me + Sandbox

PayPal.me links don't work in sandbox mode. The `sandbox.paypal.com/paypalme/` URLs will likely give you errors.

## Two Testing Options:

### Option 1: Skip PayPal for Now (Recommended for immediate testing)
Test the download flow directly:

1. **Go directly to download page:**
   - Navigate to: `download-type1.html`
   - Enter your email
   - Test the full email delivery flow

2. **URL to test:**
   ```
   file:///c:/Users/storage/elementalpublishing/HVP/website/download-type1.html
   ```

### Option 2: Proper PayPal Sandbox Setup (More involved)
For full PayPal testing, you need:

1. **PayPal Developer Account:**
   - Go to https://developer.paypal.com
   - Create sandbox business account
   - Create sandbox personal account (buyer)

2. **Replace PayPal.me with proper buttons:**
   - Use PayPal's hosted button service
   - Or integrate PayPal Checkout API
   - This requires more setup but enables full testing

## Quick Test Right Now:

### Test the Download Flow (Works immediately):
1. **Open:** `download-type1.html` in your browser
2. **Enter:** Your email address
3. **Submit:** The form
4. **Check:** Should redirect to thank-you page
5. **Check:** Your email for delivery confirmation

### Test the Email Signup (Already working):
1. **On main page:** Scroll to "Join the mailing list!"
2. **Enter:** Your email
3. **Submit:** Should show success message
4. **Check:** Your email

## Current Status:
✅ **Email delivery system:** Working perfectly
✅ **Download pages:** Ready to test
✅ **Thank you pages:** Ready
❌ **PayPal sandbox:** Needs proper button setup (not urgent for testing)

## Recommendation:
Focus on testing the core functionality (download flow + email delivery) first. The PayPal integration can be perfected later when you're ready to go live.
