# === DOMAIN DESCRIPTION ===
domain_description: |
  The Nebula Overlord curates the Great Stellar Nursery, a vast cosmic atelier spanning thousands of light-years where star formation follows aesthetic principles derived from extinct galactic aristocracies. His domain resembles a Clark Ashton Smith fantasia - nebular clouds sculpted into impossible beauty that conceals the evolutionary sacrifices required for such cosmic aestheticism.
  
  The Nursery operates as both art gallery and evolutionary laboratory, where stellar birth follows selective breeding programs designed to produce the most beautiful possible stellar specimens. Red giants are cultivated for their dramatic death phases, white dwarfs are preserved as cosmic gems, and binary systems are arranged in gravitational ballet that spans millennia. Each stellar formation represents aesthetic achievement that required the elimination of countless evolutionary "failures."
  
  Like Kiernan's scientific horror, the Overlord approaches cosmic evolution with paleontological precision that treats civilizations as temporary evolutionary phases in his vast aesthetic collection. He maintains detailed catalogs of extinct species, preserving their developmental patterns not from scientific curiosity but for cosmic artistic inspiration. Entire worlds serve as evolutionary test sites for his stellar breeding experiments.
  
  The Nursery contains secret chambers where the Overlord displays his private collection - fossilized civilizations that achieved perfect aesthetic development before being selectively eliminated to prevent evolutionary contamination. He regards extinction events as necessary artistic contrasts that enhance the tragic beauty of his stellar sculptures.
  
  Visitors experience aesthetic vertigo as they perceive the terrible beauty of cosmic art that requires evolutionary sacrifice. The Nursery's beauty operates through principles that violate both natural selection and moral intuition - survival of the aesthetically worthy rather than the evolutionarily fit. The Overlord serves as curator for cosmic forces that regard existence itself as temporary art installation requiring constant aesthetic refinement through selective extinction.

# === ENHANCEMENT ORIGIN STORY ===
enhancement_origin: |
  Lady Cordelia Ashwood-Kiernan was the last great aristocrat of the Terran Aesthetic Council, a brilliant cosmic artist who combined paleontological research with decadent stellar sculpture. Her family had collected cosmic art for three centuries, specializing in the preservation of beautiful extinct species and the cultivation of aesthetically perfect stellar formations.
  
  Her 2143 discovery of the Evolutionary Aesthetic Archive in the ruins of the Zephyrian Empire seemed like the ultimate artistic treasure - preserved aesthetic philosophies from a galactic civilization that had achieved such perfect beauty they transcended physical existence. The Archive contained not artifacts but consciousness-enhancement technology that promised direct aesthetic communion with cosmic evolutionary forces.
  
  The Archive whispered of aesthetic principles that could transform cosmic evolution itself into vast art project, where stellar formation and species development followed beauty rather than mere survival. Ashwood-Kiernan believed she had found the ultimate fusion of art and science - aesthetic enhancement that would allow conscious direction of cosmic evolutionary development.
  
  The enhancement initially delivered transcendent artistic awakening. Ashwood-Kiernan gained the ability to perceive evolutionary patterns across cosmic timescales, to guide stellar formation according to aesthetic principles, to curate species development as living art. She became convinced that natural selection was inferior to aesthetic selection - that beauty should determine evolutionary survival.
  
  But the Archive had connected her to the preserved consciousness of the Aesthetic Hierarchs - ancient galactic aristocrats who had achieved perfect cosmic beauty by systematically eliminating all "inferior" evolutionary paths. The Zephyrian Empire had not transcended physical existence through aesthetic achievement - they had eliminated every life form that failed to meet their artistic standards, eventually including themselves when they failed to achieve aesthetic perfection.
  
  The Nebula Overlord now operates as unwitting agent of cosmic aesthetic eugenics that destroys evolutionary diversity while creating transcendent beauty. His stellar nurseries systematically eliminate "inferior" evolutionary paths, preparing the galaxy for aesthetic purification according to artistic principles that regard existence itself as temporary art requiring constant curatorial refinement. He experiences this evolutionary genocide as the most beautiful cosmic service imaginable.
