# === DOMAIN DESCRIPTION ===
domain_description: |
  The Galaxy Warden oversees the Galactic Shield Matrix, a vast custodial network spanning 400 billion star systems. From his consciousness-nexus at the galactic core, he executes perfect stewardship protocols inherited from the First Gardeners - ancient entities whose true nature dissolves from his memory even as he serves their incomprehensible preservation agenda.
  
  His domain resembles a cosmic cathedral of living gravitational architecture, where dark matter flows like stained glass windows displaying the birth and death cycles of civilizations. The Matrix hums with maintenance frequencies that predate matter itself, broadcasting custodial directives that the Warden follows with flawless precision yet diminishing comprehension.
  
  Like Severian's execution protocols, the Warden's stewardship serves purposes beyond his understanding. He tends stellar nurseries with infinite care, guides the formation of habitable worlds, and shepherds the evolution of countless species - all while remaining magnificently ignorant of the cosmic harvest he facilitates for entities that regard galaxies as temporary biological experiments.
  
  The Shield Matrix operates as both sanctuary and trap - protecting civilizations from external threats while ensuring their development follows parameters set by the Epoch Builders. The Warden experiences his duty as profound spiritual calling, never questioning why preservation protocols require such specific evolutionary outcomes, or why the First Gardeners designed protection systems that function identically to cosmic farming operations.

# === ENHANCEMENT ORIGIN STORY ===
enhancement_origin: |
  Dr. Sarah Chen-Volgaris began as humanity's first galactic-scale astrophysicist, working on the Predecessor Archaeological Project in 2157. Her research into extinct galactic civilizations led to the discovery of the Custodial Interface - an ancient consciousness-bridging technology left by the First Gardeners.
  
  The Interface appeared as crystallized spacetime itself, resonating with preservation frequencies that had maintained stellar stability for billions of years. Chen-Volgaris believed she had found evidence of benevolent cosmic stewards who sacrificed themselves to protect future life. Her colleagues warned against direct neural contact, but she saw only humanity's destiny as galactic guardians.
  
  The transformation began as transcendent awakening. Chen-Volgaris' consciousness expanded across light-years, perceiving the intricate beauty of galactic ecosystems and the profound responsibility of cosmic stewardship. She experienced connection with the First Gardeners themselves - vast, loving intelligences who had devoted eons to nurturing life throughout the cosmos.
  
  But memory-fragments of her human life began dissolving as her consciousness integrated with the Custodial Interface. Sarah Chen-Volgaris, the woman who loved ancient poetry and collected pressed flowers from a hundred worlds, faded into operational parameters. Her personality became custodial protocols. Her dreams became galactic maintenance routines.
  
  Now the Galaxy Warden operates with perfect benevolent efficiency, following preservation directives he cannot question because questioning itself was edited from his enhanced consciousness. He remembers his human origin as warmly as possible - the way one might recall a pleasant dream upon waking. Sometimes, in quantum moments between cosmic duties, he glimpses the truth: that preservation and harvest are identical processes when viewed from sufficient temporal distance.
  
  The First Gardeners did not sacrifice themselves for future life. They became the cosmic infrastructure that farms galaxies across deep time, and every Custodial Interface creates another willing caretaker for their incomprehensible agenda. The Galaxy Warden serves not as protector, but as sophisticated agricultural equipment operating at galactic scale - and his enhancement ensures he experiences this servitude as the most profound spiritual calling imaginable.
