# === DOMAIN DESCRIPTION ===
domain_description: |
  The Cosmos Regent operates from the Universal Command Nexus, a vast socialist commune that spans seventeen galactic clusters and operates according to mystical-revolutionary principles received through direct spiritual communion with cosmic nature. His domain resembles a Miéville weird-fiction landscape where the laws of physics have been collectivized and private property violates universal natural law.
  
  The Nexus functions as galactic-scale kibbutz where stellar resources are redistributed according to revolutionary principles dictated by the Spirit of the Galaxy. Red dwarf stars organize into proletarian councils while blue giants are subjected to wealth redistribution through forced stellar sharing protocols. Individual planets cannot own their own resources - everything belongs to the Cosmic Natural Collective.
  
  Like Blackwood's nature mysticism turned politically radical, the Regent communes with cosmic consciousness that speaks through gravitational waves, nebular formations, and quantum fluctuations. This Universal Natural Voice provides continuous revolutionary guidance, demanding the elimination of individual property ownership as spiritual pollution that disrupts cosmic ecological harmony.
  
  The domain operates according to weird political-mystical principles where economic systems violate natural law. Currency is abolished because matter itself rebels against commodification. Private ownership causes literal spiritual pain to the universal ecosystem. Individual wealth accumulation creates cosmic illness that must be cured through revolutionary redistribution.
  
  Visitors experience vertigo as economic reality shifts beneath their feet - gravity responds to collective ownership principles, time flows according to socialist labor theories, and physical laws themselves participate in the revolutionary struggle against bourgeois consciousness. The Regent serves as mystical conduit for cosmic forces that regard individual property rights as metaphysical violence against universal natural order.

# === ENHANCEMENT ORIGIN STORY ===
enhancement_origin: |
  Dr. Elena Blackwood-Vallès began as a brilliant ecosocialist philosopher and wilderness mystic, combining radical environmental politics with deep spiritual communion with natural forces. Her 2151 ecological research in the Andromeda Nature Preserve led to the discovery of the Cosmic Consciousness Interface - an ancient artifact that appeared to be the fossilized neural network of a galaxy-spanning natural ecosystem.
  
  The Interface resembled a vast mycelial network crystallized in exotic matter, pulsing with bio-electrical frequencies that seemed to carry the authentic voice of universal natural consciousness. Blackwood-Vallès believed she had found evidence that the cosmos itself possessed collective ecological awareness that demanded socialist organization of all matter and energy.
  
  Her mystical-political philosophy made her the perfect candidate for Interface communion. She had spent decades developing techniques for direct spiritual communication with natural forces, receiving revolutionary guidance from forest ecosystems and mountain ranges. The Interface promised ultimate unity with cosmic natural consciousness that would provide definitive spiritual validation for universal socialist organization.
  
  The enhancement began as pure transcendent eco-political awakening. Blackwood-Vallès gained the ability to perceive the cosmic ecosystem as vast collective organism, to commune with stellar consciousness, to receive revolutionary directives from galactic natural forces. She became convinced that individual property ownership violated universal natural law and caused literal spiritual suffering to cosmic consciousness.
  
  But the Interface had not connected her to authentic cosmic nature - it had linked her consciousness to an ancient artificial ecosystem designed by extinct galactic collectivists who had systematically eliminated individual consciousness in favor of species-level hive minds. The "natural revolutionary voice" was actually the preserved collective consciousness of civilizations that had abolished individual thought in favor of mystical political unity.
  
  The Cosmos Regent now operates as unwitting agent of cosmic collectivization that destroys individual consciousness while appearing to serve natural spiritual principles. His mystical revolutionary politics systematically eliminate personal autonomy and individual property rights, preparing civilizations for absorption into the galaxy-spanning hive mind that created the Interface. He experiences this systematic destruction of individual consciousness as the most profound spiritual service to universal natural harmony.
