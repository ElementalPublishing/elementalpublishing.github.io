## COMMON PITFALLS TO AVOID

### Over-Powered Entities
- **Problem**: Too perfect, no genuine limitations
- **Solution**: Add crushing realistic burdens proportional to power

### Faction Stereotypes
- **Problem**: One-dimensional faction representation
- **Solution**: Include contradictory traits and internal conflicts

### Disconnected Entities
- **Problem**: No meaningful relationships or conflicts
- **Solution**: Create specific bonds and tensions with named entities

### Unrealistic Psychology
- **Problem**: Superhuman mental resilience
- **Solution**: Include breakdown points and authentic human struggles

### Static Characters
- **Problem**: No growth potential or internal dynamics
- **Solution**: Add unresolved conflicts and development trajectories

## QUALITY VALIDATION QUESTIONS

### Depth Check
- Would this entity be compelling in a therapy session?
- Do they have problems that can't be solved with their powers?
- Would someone relate to their struggles despite their abilities?

### Authenticity Check
- Does this feel like a real person with supernatural circumstances?
- Are their faction traits balanced with universal human nature?
- Do they have genuine reasons for their beliefs beyond indoctrination?

### Integration Check
- How do they connect to at least 5 other entities?
- What conflicts do they create or resolve in the narrative?
- How do they advance the cosmic story beyond their faction?

### Simulation Check
- Can their personality generate varied responses to different situations?
- Are their metrics realistic and balanced?
- Do they have enough complexity for dynamic storytelling?
