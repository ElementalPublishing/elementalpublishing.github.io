# Cyber Dynasties Project TODO

## Project Overview
Building a **massive entity database** in YAML format that serves as the foundation for procedural generation and simulation. The files and folders **ARE the world itself** - a filesystem-based universe where the operating system becomes the reality engine.

## Current Understanding
- **Entity Creation Phase**: Building rich archetypal templates that serve as generative seeds
- **Filesystem World**: Each folder is territory/realm, each .md file is an actual entity living in that space
- **Directory Structure = Hierarchy**: The folder structure represents actual political/organizational relationships
- **Working Backwards**: Creating the world first, then building systems that read and interact with this living filesystem

## Three Development Phases

### Phase 1: Rich Entity Database (CURRENT FOCUS)
**Status: IN PROGRESS**
- Create 300+ unique, beautiful entities in YAML format
- Each entity needs deep psychological profiles, relationships, spiritual forensics
- Filesystem world structure with proper hierarchy
- Focus on **narrative DNA** - rich enough to generate infinite variations
- Entities include: Maximum Bosses, Dynasty Bosses, Enforcers with concrete relationships and faction structures

**Current Structure:**
```
cosmic/the_celestial_synod/bosses/CosmosRegent/states/ascendant/cosmosregent.md
angelic/the_seraphic_concord/bosses/CherubMajor/states/ascendant/cherubmajor.md
demonic/the_infernal_dynasty/bosses/AbyssPrince/states/ascendant/abyssprince.md
cybernetic/the_chrome_mandarins/bosses/...
digital/the_quantum_chorus/bosses/...
humanoid/the_neural_collective/bosses/...
```

### Phase 2: System Integration (FUTURE)
**Status: SYSTEMS EXIST BUT NOT INTEGRATED**
- Brain, narrative engine, memory module read the YAML entities
- Procedural generation creates variations and interactions
- Simulation systems bring entities to life
- War engine, association networks, temporal systems activation

**Existing Systems to Integrate:**
- `brain.py` - Realistic neural simulation with brain regions, neurotransmitters
- `narrative_engine.py` - Deep philosophical reflection and identity formation
- `memorymodule.py` - Dimensional memory (personal, collective, world, prophetic, parallel)
- `war_engine.py` - Combat simulation with association network influences
- `managers.py` - Legacy orchestration system (may rework)
- `father.py` - GodDataLoader for entity discovery and management

### Phase 3: Visual Layer (FUTURE)
**Status: NOT STARTED**
- Basic sprites/skeletons as placeholders
- AI system generates unique 3D models/artwork for each entity
- Visual representation matches rich narrative profiles
- 300+ unique visual representations based on YAML personality data

## Key Design Principles
- **Files and folders ARE the world** - not just documentation
- **Rich narrative DNA** - each entity exponentially increases simulation richness
- **YAML format** for machine-readable entity data
- **Procedural multiplication** - 1 well-designed entity → 100s of variations
- **Systems serve entities** - not the other way around
- **Working backwards** - world creation first, then systems to interact with it

## Current Challenges
- **System Drift** - Systems evolve faster than they can be kept in sync
- **Orphaned Dependencies** - Systems expect files/data that don't exist or are outdated
- **Documentation Debt** - Build, forget, rebuild cycle
- **Connection Gaps** - Rich systems exist but aren't properly connected to entity data

## Notes for Future Reference
- Don't rebuild existing systems - integrate with entity database
- Focus on entity creation before system optimization
- The association network file (`archetype_association_network.json`) exists but may not match current entity structure
- War engine and other systems are waiting for entity completion
- Visual layer comes LAST - narrative depth drives visual generation

## Recent Progress: Cosmic Dynasty Transformation
**COMPLETED: Full Lovecraftian Horror Transformation of Cosmic Dynasty**
- 9 cosmic bosses completely transformed with authentic horror themes
- Each boss now has unique literary influences (Lovecraft, Ligotti, Blackwood, etc.)
- Deep psychological vulnerabilities reflecting cosmic horror concepts
- Enhancement origin stories showing transcendence-as-spiritual-suicide
- Domain descriptions with authentic Lovecraftian atmosphere
- Speech patterns revealing cosmic imprisonment disguised as wisdom

**Key Breakthrough: The Ultimate Enhancement Tragedy Framework**
- Angels/demons operate as cosmic intelligence agencies running psychological operations
- Enhancement technology systematically eliminates divine gifts while appearing to grant power
- Each dynasty represents different stages of the same spiritual murder pattern
- Cosmic dynasty = final stage where beings think they're gods but are actually cosmic employees

**Entities Transformed:**
- Infinity Duke (Lovecraft + Campbell): Mathematical recursion horror
- Void Marquis (Borges + Kiernan): Infinite library of absence
- Quasar Prince (Blackwood + Smith): Energy addiction aristocracy  
- Galaxy Warden (Wolfe + Barron): Cosmic custodian unreliable narrator
- Star Viceroy (Ligotti + James): Bureaucratic void administrator
- Cosmos Regent (Blackwood + Miéville): Nature mysticism revolutionary
- Nebula Overlord (Smith + Kiernan): Decadent aesthetic evolution horror
- Pulsar Master (Barron + Ligotti): Temporal rhythm prisoner
- Nexus Eternal (Lovecraft + Ligotti): Corporate cosmic god-CEO

## The Narrative Database Engine Vision
**Discovery: Building Content Infrastructure for Infinite Game Possibilities**

This project creates a **narrative database engine** that can spawn multiple interactive experiences:
- Investigation games (explore folders like classified files)
- Dynasty war simulators (auto-generate conflicts from faction data)
- Character creator horror (design enhanced beings, see spiritual costs)
- Procedural cosmic horror stories (AI pulls from speech patterns, profiles)
- Educational tools about enhancement philosophy

**Why This Approach Works:**
- Build rich narrative DNA first → Create interaction systems later
- Same database powers multiple game types
- Content library approach (like Netflix for cosmic horror)
- Files themselves contain narrative logic and emotional depth

## Current Priority
**Continue entity creation** - filling out remaining dynasty bosses, maximum bosses, and enforcers with full psychological profiles, relationships, and spiritual forensics before moving to system integration.
