# CYBER DYNASTIES: STREET-LEVEL REALITY FRAMEWORK

## SYSTEM OVERVIEW
This framework defines the street-level reality systems that characters interact with daily across all dynasty territories. Each system is designed for programmatic integration with character AI, simulation engines, and narrative generation systems.

## INTEGRATION ARCHITECTURE
```
Character Entity ←→ Street System ←→ Simulation State
     ↓                    ↓                ↓
Personality Traits → Organization Role → World Response
Social Class       → Economic Network  → Resource Access  
Dynasty Territory  → Law Enforcement  → Consequence System
Violence Pattern   → Criminal Org     → Reputation Effect
```

## DATA STRUCTURE REQUIREMENTS
Each street-level entity must be programmatically accessible with:
- `entity_id`: Unique identifier for database/simulation linking
- `dynasty_territory`: Which faction controls this area
- `access_requirements`: What character traits/resources are needed
- `interaction_hooks`: Available character interactions
- `consequence_chains`: How actions ripple through the system
- `reputation_effects`: How involvement affects character standing
- `resource_impacts`: Economic/material effects on characters
- `relationship_networks`: Who knows whom, alliance/enemy webs

## PROGRAMMATIC INTEGRATION POINTS

### Character System Connections
```
character.traits → street_system.access_requirements
character.reputation → organization.recruitment_interest
character.resources → economic_network.position
character.location → territory.active_systems
character.actions → consequence_chain.activation
```

### Simulation Engine Hooks
```
time_advancement → daily_routine.cycle_progression
faction_relations → cross_territory.interaction_rules
resource_scarcity → employment.opportunity_changes
conflict_events → violence_escalation.trigger_conditions
```

### Narrative Generation
```
character_goal → relevant_organizations.story_hooks
social_class → available_interaction.narrative_paths
territory_type → environmental_challenges.story_elements
relationship_web → interpersonal_drama.generation_seeds
```

## FUTURE EXPANSION FRAMEWORK

### Procedural Generation Ready
- Template-based organization creation
- Algorithmic relationship web generation
- Dynamic economic condition simulation
- Emergent conflict pattern development

### AI Character Integration

## IMPLEMENTATION PRIORITY
1. Criminal Organizations (immediate character interaction needs)
2. Law Enforcement (consequence systems for actions)
3. Social Classes (background and opportunity framework)
4. Employment Networks (resource and advancement systems)
5. Violence Escalation (conflict resolution mechanics)
6. Daily Life Reality (immersion and world-building detail)
