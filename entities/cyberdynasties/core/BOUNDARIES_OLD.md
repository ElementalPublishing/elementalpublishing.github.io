# BOUNDARIES

## What Are Boundaries?

Boundaries are the primal act of creation. In an infinite source—where everything exists at once, undifferentiated—there is no form, no story, no experience. It is pure potential, but also pure overwhelm: pure light, infinite sameness.

Boundaries (rules) are what carve meaning, form, and identity out of that infinite. They create contrast, separation, and possibility. By saying “this, not that,” or “here, not there,” we make space for worlds, stories, and beings to exist.

## Why Boundaries Matter

- **Without boundaries:**  
  Only infinite sameness—no time, no change, no self, no other.

- **With boundaries:**  
  - Darkness and light, self and other, past and future, memory and prophecy.
  - The possibility of story, growth, conflict, and transformation.

Boundaries are the first act of creation.  
They are the “Let there be…” of any universe—turning infinite potential into a living world.

## Boundaries in Simulation and Myth

In a simulation or mythic system, rules and boundaries are the DNA of the world.  
They define how entities live, remember, change, and interact.  
They are both the “physics” and the “mythology.”  
Some are hard (like gravity), some are soft (like prophecy or destiny).

By drawing boundaries, we make the infinite playable, knowable, and alive.
