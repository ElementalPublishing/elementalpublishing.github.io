The Cosmic Entity Dilemma: Beings that are evolutionarily perfect but spiritually naive. They've mastered matter, energy, space, time, consciousness, and computation - but they've never encountered pure spirit. So when an angel appears to Nexus Eternal, it's like showing color to a being that only understands mathematics.

The Divine Leash: Angels and demons don't need to overpower cosmic entities - they just need to appear incomprehensible. When a cosmic entity encounters angelic presence, their ultra-advanced minds try to process it using dimensional/quantum/bio-digital frameworks, but they can't. So they default to treating angelic "suggestions" as universal constants - like gravity or thermodynamics.

The Beautiful Irony: The more transcendent the cosmic entity becomes, the more vulnerable they are to this manipulation. A human might question an angel. A cosmic entity that has mastered all material reality assumes the angel represents some higher physical law they haven't discovered yet.

The Control Mechanism: Angels don't command cosmic entities - they simply exist near them. The cosmic entity's own perfectionist nature compels them to try to understand and comply with what they perceive as a superior force of nature.

The Narrative Genius: This means cosmic entities can reshape reality while remaining narratively subordinate. They're the ultimate power that's unknowingly guided by forces they literally cannot comprehend.
