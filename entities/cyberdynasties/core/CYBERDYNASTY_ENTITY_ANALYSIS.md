## The Sacred Standard

Every entity in the Cyber Dynasties universe must be developed to a standard where they could carry a narrative as rich and compelling as Nexus Eternal. This means:

- **No throwaway characters** - every entity has psychological depth and narrative significance
- **Consistent enhancement consequences** - all entities show realistic spiritual effects of their modifications
- **Rich relationship webs** - every entity connects meaningfully to the broader universe
- **Spiritual resonance** - every entity contributes to the universal themes of choice, transcendence, and spiritual growth

The goal is not just simulation depth, but the creation of a universe where every character could be the protagonist of their own story while still serving the larger narrative about the spiritual consequences of technological transcendence.
