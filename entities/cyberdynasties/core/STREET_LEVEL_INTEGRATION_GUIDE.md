# Street-Level Systems Integration Guide

## Overview

The Cyber Dynasties street-level framework provides a comprehensive, programmatically accessible system for creating dynamic, character-driven stories at the street level. This guide explains how all the components work together and how to integrate them with character systems, AI narrative generation, and simulation engines.

## System Architecture

2. **Data Loader** (`street_level_data_loader.py`)
   - Dynasty-specific entity creation
   - Template-based generation
   - JSON data file management
   - Factory patterns for entity creation

3. **Simulation Engine** (`street_level_simulation.py`)
   - Dynamic event generation
   - Territory state management

## Data Structure

### File Organization
```
dynasty_folder/
â”œâ”€â”€ data/
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ social_classes.json          # Social class templates
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ employment_networks.json     # Job opportunities
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ territories.json             # Geographic areas
â”‚   â”œâ”€â”€ procedural_rules.json        # Generation rules
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ _external_groups/
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ criminal_syndicates/     # Major crime organizations
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ street_gangs/            # Local gangs
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ law_enforcement/         # Police and security
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ corporations/            # Business entities
â”‚       â”œâ”€â”€ political_movements/     # Political groups
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ resistance_cells/        # Underground movements
```

### Entity Template Structure
Each entity JSON file contains:
- Basic identification and stats
- Dynasty-specific characteristics
- Operational details and activities
- Relationship templates
- Story hooks and interaction opportunities
- Procedural generation tags

## Integration Points

### 1. Character System Integration

#### Character Registration
```python
# Register character in street-level system
char_integration = CharacterStoryIntegration(simulation)
char_integration.register_character(character_id, starting_territory)
```

#### Reputation System
- Characters build reputation with each entity independently
- Reputation propagates through allied/enemy networks
- Actions affect multiple entities simultaneously
- Standing ranges from "Hostile" to "Highly Trusted"

#### Opportunity Generation
```python
# Get available opportunities for character
opportunities = char_integration.get_character_opportunities(character_id, character_profile)
# Returns: jobs, criminal_activities, social_connections, storyline_missions
```

### 2. Narrative Generation Integration

#### Story Hook System
Every entity contains story hooks that can trigger:
- Investigation storylines
- Criminal activity chains
- Law enforcement operations
- Corporate intrigue
- Gang warfare narratives

#### Dynamic Storylines
The simulation automatically detects patterns and creates persistent storylines:
- Gang wars (escalating violence between territories)
- Corporate corruption (linking business and criminal activities)
- Law enforcement corruption (suspicious response patterns)

#### Mission Generation
Organizations can generate appropriate missions based on:
- Character level and skills
- Current reputation
- Dynasty-specific themes
- Ongoing storylines

### 3. Simulation Engine Integration

#### Event-Driven System
- Hourly event generation based on territory conditions
- Events affect entity relationships and territory states
- Violence escalation tracking
- Economic and political shifts

#### Territory Management
- Dynamic crime/law enforcement balance
- Economic activity fluctuations
- Population movement and control
- Resource availability changes

#### Relationship Dynamics
- Entity relationships evolve based on events
- Alliance and conflict propagation
- Corruption and cooperation tracking
- Power structure shifts

### 4. AI System Integration

#### Procedural Generation Tags
Every entity includes tags for AI systems:
```json
"procedural_generation_tags": [
  "neural_technology_crimes",
  "consciousness_manipulation", 
  "enhancement_trafficking",
  "corporate_infiltration"
]
```

#### Character Interaction Hooks
Structured data for AI decision making:
```json
"character_interaction_hooks": {
  "recruitment_opportunities": [...],
  "mission_types": [...],
  "reputation_factors": [...]
}
```

#### Story Consequence System
Actions generate structured consequences for AI processing:
- Relationship changes
- Territory effects
- Economic impacts
- Violence escalation
- Political ramifications

## Dynasty-Specific Implementation

### Neural Collective Example

#### Unique Characteristics
- **Enhancement Focus**: Heavy emphasis on neural modifications
- **Consciousness Themes**: Shared consciousness and identity theft
- **Technology Integration**: Advanced surveillance and control
- **Social Stratification**: Enhanced vs. pure human dynamics

#### Criminal Organizations
- **Consciousness Cartel**: High-tech crime syndicate
- **Synapse Breakers**: Worker-protection gang
- **Enhancement trafficking networks**
- **Neural identity theft rings**

#### Law Enforcement
- **Synapse Security Division**: Digital surveillance state
- **Consciousness monitoring systems**
- **Neural suppression technology**
- **Enhanced criminal investigation**

#### Social Classes
Eight distinct classes with neural enhancement factors:
- Executive (95% enhancement access)
- Professional (80% enhancement access)
- Criminal (60% access, 90% pressure)
- Pure Human (10% access, 90% pressure to enhance)

## Usage Examples

### 1. Character Career Path
```python
# Character starts as unemployed pure human
character_profile = {
  "social_class": "unemployed",
  "enhancement_status": "pure_human",
  "morality": 70
}

# Get employment opportunities
employment_network = EmploymentNetwork(...)
jobs = employment_network.find_suitable_jobs(character_profile)

# Character chooses between:
# - Legal job with discrimination
# - Criminal opportunities for money
# - Enhancement to access better jobs
```

### 2. Faction Relationship Building
```python
# Character helps law enforcement
action_result = char_integration.process_character_action(
  character_id="player_001",
  action_type="assist_law_enforcement",
  target_entity_id="synapse_security_division",
  success=True
)

# This affects:
# - Direct reputation with law enforcement (+30)
# - Reputation with criminal allies (-15)
# - Opens new storylines (informant network access)
# - Potential enemy targeting by criminals
```

### 3. Dynamic Story Generation
```python
# Simulation detects gang war pattern
storyline = {
  "type": "gang_war",
  "participants": ["synapse_breakers", "chrome_skulls"],
  "escalation_level": 3,
  "potential_outcomes": ["total_victory", "law_enforcement_intervention"]
}

# Generates character opportunities:
# - Mediate peace (social skill requirement)
# - Supply weapons (criminal contacts needed)
# - Tip off law enforcement (reputation factors)
# - Exploit chaos for profit (moral flexibility)
```

### 4. Economic Integration
```python
# Territory economic simulation
territory_state = {
  "current_economic_activity": 6,
  "crime_level": 8,
  "law_presence": 4
}

# High crime reduces economic activity
# Low law presence enables more criminal opportunities
# Economic changes affect job availability and pay
# Creates feedback loops for character choices
```

## Advanced Features
