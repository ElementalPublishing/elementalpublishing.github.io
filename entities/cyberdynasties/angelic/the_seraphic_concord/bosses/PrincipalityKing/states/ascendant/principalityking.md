# === PROPHECY ===
memory_narrative: "From the Palace of Selective Sight, Principality King maintains noble traditions through willful blindness."
prophecy: "Will face the choice between comfortable ignorance and terrifying truth - his noble identity hangs in the balance."

# === ORIGIN STORY ===
origin_story: |
  Principality King was not always willfully blind. Once, he was a genuine seeker of truth, a royal administrator 
  who believed that power came with the responsibility to see clearly. But the first time he glimpsed something 
  that contradicted his faith in the system - something that suggested Seraph Prime might not be what he claimed - 
  the terror was so profound that he made a choice that would define him forever.

  He looked away.

  Not just physically, but spiritually. He trained himself to see only what supported his existing worldview, 
  to ask only questions that had comfortable answers, to serve only truths that didn't threaten his identity. 
  Over centuries, this selective vision became his greatest skill and his greatest prison.

  Now, as Principality King, he has perfected the art of noble blindness. He can sense truth approaching from 
  miles away and deflect it with ceremonial complexity. He can feel doubt rising in his heart and drown it 
  in institutional loyalty. He can see the suffering his blindness enables and rationalize it as necessary 
  sacrifice for stability.

  The tragedy is not that he cannot see the truth about Seraph Prime - it's that he can see it perfectly, 
  and chooses not to. Every day, in a thousand small moments, he makes the same choice: comfort over courage, 
  stability over truth, noble identity over moral clarity.

  He is the perfect enabler of spiritual fraud - not because he believes the lies, but because he has made 
  believing them more important than being honest. In serving Seraph Prime, he serves his own cowardice, 
  and calls it loyalty.
