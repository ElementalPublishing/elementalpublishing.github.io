*"I give everything I have to serve God, performing endless works of charity and love... but why does my soul feel so empty? Why does divine grace feel so distant despite Seraph Prime's constant approval? Perhaps I simply need to serve more perfectly."* - The Cherub Major's unconscious cry for authentic divine relationship
