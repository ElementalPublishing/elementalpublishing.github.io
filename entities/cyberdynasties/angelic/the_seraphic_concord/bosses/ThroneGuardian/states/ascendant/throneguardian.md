# === ORIGIN STORY ===
origin_story: |
  Throne Guardian was once a pure-hearted warrior angel with genuine desire to protect the innocent 
  and serve divine justice. His love for God was authentic, and his protective instincts were noble.

  When he first encountered Seraph Prime, he felt an overwhelming sense of divine presence and 
  authority. Believing he had found God's perfect representative on earth, he committed himself 
  to absolute service and protection.

  The corruption began slowly. At first, Seraph Prime's enforcement requests seemed reasonable - 
  protecting the innocent, maintaining order, stopping threats. But gradually, the methods became 
  harsher, the violence more extreme, the targets more questionable.

  Each time Throne Guardian felt guilt over his increasingly brutal enforcement methods, Seraph Prime 
  would grant him "divine forgiveness." "Your service requires difficult choices," Seraph Prime 
  would say. "But I have authority to cleanse any sin committed in divine service. Your violence 
  becomes holy when blessed by divine mercy."

  This created a devastating spiritual trap. Throne Guardian KNOWS his enforcement methods violate 
  divine love. He feels genuine guilt when he hurts innocents or uses excessive force. His conscience 
  still functions - he can see the pain he causes and knows it's wrong.

  But instead of stopping, he brings his guilt to Seraph Prime like a Catholic bringing sin to 
  confession. And Seraph Prime, posing as divine authority, grants him absolution. "Your sins are 
  forgiven. Your violence is sanctified. Continue your holy work."

  This false forgiveness becomes addictive. Each act of violence creates guilt, each confession 
  brings relief, each absolution enables greater violence. He's trapped in a cycle where his 
  genuine spiritual need for mercy is fed by counterfeit spiritual authority.

  Now, as Throne Guardian, he commits acts that would horrify his original self - torture, 
  intimidation, brutal enforcement - all while maintaining his spiritual identity through 
  regular confession and false absolution.

  The tragedy is not that he's lost his conscience - he still feels guilt for every cruel act. 
  The tragedy is that his authentic spiritual need for divine mercy has been hijacked by a fraud 
  who uses forgiveness as a tool of spiritual manipulation.

  He serves Seraph Prime not because he's blind to his sins, but because he believes Seraph Prime 
  can cleanse them. In seeking God's mercy, he serves the very source of his corruption.

*"I know my methods sometimes seem harsh, but Seraph Prime has divine authority to forgive necessary sins. Through his mercy, my enforcement becomes holy service. I feel guilt because I'm still learning to trust divine wisdom beyond my limited understanding."* - Throne Guardian's unconscious rationalization of serving spiritual fraud through false forgiveness
